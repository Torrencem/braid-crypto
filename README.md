# braid-crypto

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Torrencem/braid-crypto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Torrencem/braid-crypto)

This is a project for my undergraduate course on Cryptography. This is very much a work in progress. There's not much in the way of a binary, but you can build with "cargo build" or run the tests I've been setting up with "cargo test". Here are several links to everything I'm using:

I also took much inspiration from this package:

Specifically, this source page for braidPermutation and other representational issues:
